 Simulation of the Craps dice game
 If the first roll of 2 die sums to a 7 or 11, the round is won. If the first
 roll of 2 die sums to 2, 3, or 12 ("craps"), the round is lost. Tally the win 
 or loss. 
 If none of the above is rolled initially, the total rolled (sum) is saved as
 the point (a point is established). Continue rolling the dice until either a 7
 is rolled or the point is rolled (ending the round). If the point is rolled 
 before a 7, the round is won. If the 7 is rolled before the point, the round is
 lost. Tally the win or loss.
